# Rhotrix Library

The Rhotrix Library is a Python library designed to implement and manipulate Rhotrix matrices. Rhotrix matrices can be either rhomboidal or coupled matrices, providing a unique and specialized way to handle these mathematical structures.

## Features

- Initialize and manipulate Rhotrix matrices.
- Perform matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
- Scalar multiplication with integer or float values.
- Convert between rhomboidal and coupled matrix forms.
- Generate identity matrices.
- Extract the central element of the matrix, referred to as the "heart".

## Installation

To install the Rhotrix Library, you can simply clone this repository:

```sh
pip install rhotrix
```
